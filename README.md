# About me...

Hello, my name is Daniel Loehnert, and I am a Marine Corps veteran changing my career to data analytics. I am in the middle of my bachelor’s degree in IT and planning to finish that up by December of 2024. I recently graduated Savvy Coders bootcamp in December 2023 with skills in Agile, Excel, Jira, VS Code and Python. I am looking for a highly motivated team who challenges their employees but still values leadership and improving skills daily. My work ethic, determination, and skills that I have learned will be a great asset to any data analytics team.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning more skills in Python along with Security+ training.
- 💬 Ask me about my personal projects that I have completed through a boot camp with Savvy Coders.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can reach me through my LinkedIn profile which can be found here www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-loehnert
- 🏈 I am a huge college football fan. I also really enjoy playing golf and swimming. If you don't find me outside doing one of those activities, then I am probably inside enjoying some video games or relaxing watching a show.
