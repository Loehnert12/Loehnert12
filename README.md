# About me...

Hello, my name is Daniel Loehnert, and I am a Marine Corps veteran and a data analyst. I have a bachelor’s degree in IT from American Military University that I received in June 2025. I am looking for a highly motivated team who challenges their employees but still values leadership and improving skills daily. My work ethic, determination, and skills that I have learned will be a great asset to any data analytics team.

- 🌱 I’m currently working as a data analyst with IronEagleX and am strengthening my skills in Python.
- 💬 Ask me about my personal projects that I have completed through a boot camp with Savvy Coders and other projects with work.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can reach me through my LinkedIn profile which can be found here www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-loehnert
- 🏈 I am a huge college football fan. I also really enjoy playing golf and swimming. If you don't find me outside doing one of those activities, then I am probably inside enjoying some video games or relaxing watching a show.
